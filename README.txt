whatsit::
---------
IEMguts is an extension-library (aka: external, plugin) for 
miller.s.puckette's realtime computer-music environment "Pure data"; 
it is of no use without Pure data

IEMguts is a collection of objects that deal with the infrastructure to build 
better abstractions.
they might be of no use on their own...


danger::
--------
IEMguts often deal with non-official internals of Pure data.
These internals might change in future versions of Pd, rendering IEMguts unuseable.
Always make sure that you are using IEMguts with the same version as it was compiled with!
Else you might experience non-functional, crashing or exploding intestines.
